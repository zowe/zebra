## Design Approach
  The design approach used in the project is based on the following:  
  - Data Flow Design  
    SMF/RMF data is retrieved over the internet in XML format. The XML is then passed to the parsing engine and an output in JSON/CSV format is produced. The outputs for Realtime RMF reports are saved into a NoSQL database. Performance metrics from Realtime reports are exposed through an endpoint and Scraped Using Prometheus.
  - Architecture Design  
    The project will follow a Three Layer Architecture so that the objects in the system as a whole can be organized to best separate concerns and prepare for distribution and reuse.
  - Graphical Tool  
    Prometheus serves as a data source for building Realtime dashboards using a graphical tool. The project makes use of an open source graphical tool (Grafana) for creating real time monitoring dashboards from parsed RMF data.
