## Design Pattern:
  The Application Classes were factored into the following 3 layers:  
  i. The App-Server Layer  
    This layer consist of the following components:  
    a. HTTP GET Functions  
      These functions send a HTTP GET Request to RMF DDS server for RMF Monitor III or RMF Post Processor data.  
    b. Parser  
      This consist of functions for parsing RMF Monitor III and RMF Post Processor data.  
    c. Model  
      This consist of Schema definitions for data to be saved into MongoDB.  
  ii. The data Layer  
    This layer contains the two data warehouse for the project:  
    a. Prometheus  
      Prometheus saves Realtime Performance metrics exposed by the parsing Engine.  
    b. MongoDB  
      MongoDB saves Realtime data output from the parsing Engine.  
  iii. The Presentation Layer  
    This layer consist of:  
    a. Zowe API Catalog/Browser  
      This tool displays JSON output from the parsing Engine.  
    b. Grafana  
      This tool displays dashboard from real time data output from the parsing Engine.
