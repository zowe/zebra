## System Design Consideration
  1. Directories  
    i. Root Directory  
      This directory consist of:  
      - App.js file  
        This is the file contain app/server code.    
      - Cpurealtime.js  
        This file contains function that expose real time CPU utilization metrics using prom-client library.  
      - Mongo.js  
        This file contains functions that save real time parsing engine output to MongoDB.  
    ii. App Server Directory  
      This directory Consist of:  
      - Controllers folder  
        This folder is made up of files that contain functions controlling the Events/Actions of the parsing Engine.  
      - Parser folder  
        This folder is made up of files containing functions for parsing real time and post processor data by the parsing Engine.  
      - Models folder  
        This folder contains Schema files for saving data to MongoDB as well as db.js file which contains functions for connecting to MongoDB.  
      - Routes folder  
        This folder contain files for mapping URL Endpoints to controller functions of the parsing Engine.  
    iii. Config
      This directory consist of:  
      - Zconfig.json  
        This file contains the configurations of the parsing engine in JSON format.
  2. Exception Handling  
    Exception Handlers occur at the application level. Errors are displayed in JSON format.
