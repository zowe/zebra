## Activity Diagram  
  1. ***RMF Monitor III Activity Diagram***  
    ![](/Documentation/Images/rmf3ad.png)  
    RMF Monitor III Activities starts when a User trigger a request using the /v1/{lpar}/rmf3 Endpoint, This leads to a series of activities involving v1Router, RMF3Controller and RMF3Parser. A Condition exist to check is the Request to DDS server is successful, this condition determines the data that get returned to RMF3Controller and finally to the User.  In the End, the user receives a JSON Response containing parsed RMF III report or Error Message in case of a failed request to DDS.  
  2. ***RMF Post Processor Activity Diagram***

    RMF Monitor I Activities starts when a User trigger a request using the /v1/{lpar}/rmfpp Endpoint, This leads to a series of activities involving v1Router, RMFPPController and RMFPPParser. Two conditions exist in the activity flow of RMF post Processor. First is the condition that checks if the request to DDS server is successful. The Second one checks the value of the Report parameter specified by the user during a request. The value of the report parameter is used to determine the parser for the returned by the request to DDS.  
  3. ***Static XML File Activity Diagram***

    Static XML File to JSON Activities starts when a User trigger a request using the /static Endpoint, This leads to a series of activities involving staticXMLRouter, staticXMLFileController and RMFPPParser. A re-use of the RMFPPParser occurs here. Two conditions exist in the activity flow of static File to JSON as well. First is the condition that checks if reading the static file specified by the user in the URL’s file (takes file path as value) parameter is successful. The Second one checks the value of the Report parameter specified by the user during a request. The value of the report parameter is used to determine the parser for the returned by the request to DDS.  
  4. ***MongoV1 Activity Diagram***

    Activities of the Mongo class do not require user intervention. A setInterval function runs continuously at an interval specified in the Apps Configuration. This function serves as a trigger and make use of RMF III Activities to retrieve and store JSON into MongoDB.  
  5. ***Prometheus Metrics Activity Diagram***

    Just like in Mongo Class, Activities of the prometheus Realtime Metrics (PromMetricsv1) class do not need user intervention. The setInterval function triggers RMF III Activities which returns a JSON. Through a call back function, Prometheus Realtime Metrics class filters the JSON and create Prometheus custom gauge metrics for Effective utilization, MSU and Total utilization values. These Metrics are then saved to a prom-client library register.
