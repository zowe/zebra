## Class Diagram
![](/Documentation/Images/classdiagram.png)
The class diagram shows directional association between the project classes. Classes are represented in the project by files with “.js” as file extension.  
Routers classes are the starting point of communication with other classes as they map incoming API request from users to controller and parser classes. The Router class names contains the word “Router” at the end. These classes are responsible for recognizing the app’s endpoint.  
Controller class names contains the word “Controller” at the end and consist of functions for:  
  - Sending GET Request to DDS server
  - Sending XML to Parser
  - Filtering parsed JSON based on user specified parameters in the URL
  - Displaying the JSON response to User
  - Adding Configuration settings to the App  
Parser classes consist of functions for parsing XML to JSON. RMF monitor III parser has a single function which can parse all RMF III XML reports due to their format consistency. Monitor I parser (RMFPPparser) has two functions for parsing CPU post processor and Workload Postprocessor data.  
Mongo and cpuRealTimeMetrics classes have a setInterval() function which makes them run continuously at an interval specified by the user in the app configuration.   They both interact with monitor III router to retrieve a JSON.  
Mongo class is responsible for retrieving real time CPC, PROC and USAGE monitor III reports and fed them into MongoDB while cpuRealTimeMetrics class is responsible for retrieving real time CPC report JSON, filtering the JSON for Total utilization, MSU value and Effective Utilization values. It then use prom client library to create custom gauge metric. The custom metrics are saved into a register. The metrics in the register are exposed via an Endpoint in the mainRouter class. The exposed metrics can then be scraped by Prometheus and real time charts can be plotted using Grafana.
