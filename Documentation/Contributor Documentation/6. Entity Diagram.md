## Entity Diagram
  The Project make use of MongoDB. Mongoose library was used to structure the data. In MongoDB each entry in a database is called a document. In MongoDB a collection of documents is called a collection (think “table” if you’re used to relational databases). In Mongoose the definition of a document is called a schema.
  1. ***CPC Activity***  
  ![](/Documentation/Images/cpcschema.png)  
  For CPC report, the main document definition is named cpcActivitySchema. The document contains the following fields:
  -	***Lpar_name***  
    This represent the name of the lpar from which the report was retrieved.  
  -	***title***:  
    Title is a string that represent the report title  
  -	***DateTime***  
     This is a datetime object that represent the CPC report date and time.  
  -	***Caption***  
     This is an array and is populated by CPC report caption key.  
  -	***Lpar***  
      This is an array and is populated by an array of the CPC report table key.  
         The Mongo Class Create CPC Activity data as a series of documents.

  - ***Lpar_usage***  
    This is an array and is populated by an array of USAGE report table key
  The Mongo Class Create USAGE Activity data as a series of documents.
  4. ***Workload Activity***  
  ![](/Documentation/Images/workloadschema.png)  
  For USAGE report, the main document definition is named workloadActivitySchema. The document contains the following fields:
  -	***Lpar_name***  
    This represent the name of the lpar from which the report was retrieved.  
  -	***title***:  
    Title is a string that represent the report title  
  -	***DateTime***  
     This is a datetime object that represent the Workload report date and time.
