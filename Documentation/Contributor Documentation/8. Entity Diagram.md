## Entity Diagram
  The Project make use of MongoDB. Mongoose library was used to structure the data. In MongoDB each entry in a database is called a document. In MongoDB a collection of documents is called a collection (think “table” if you’re used to relational databases). In Mongoose the definition of a document is called a schema.
  1. CPC Activity  
  ![](/Documentation/Images/cpcschema.png)  
  For CPC report, the main document definition is named cpcActivitySchema. The document contains the following fields:
  - title:
    Title is a string that represent the report title
  - Date
    This is a string that represent the CPC report date.
  - Time
    This is a string that represent the CPC report time.
  - Caption
    This is an array and is populated by CPC report caption key.
  - Lpar
    This is an array and is populated by an array of the CPC report table key.
  The Mongo Class Create CPC Activity data as a series of documents.
  2. PROC Activity  
  ![](/Documentation/Images/procschema.png)  
  For PROC report, the main document definition is named procActivitySchema. The document contains the following fields:
  - title:
    Title is a string that represent the report title
  - Date
    This is a string that represent the PROC report date.
  - Time
    This is a string that represent the PROC report time.
  - Lpar_proc
    This is an array and is populated by an array of PROC report table key
  The Mongo Class Create PROC Activity data as a series of documents.
  3. USAGE Activity

  For USAGE report, the main document definition is named usageActivitySchema. The document contains the following fields:
  - title:
    Title is a string that represent the report title

    This is a string that represent the USAGE report date.
  - Time
    This is a string that represent the USAGE report time.
  - Lpar_usage
    This is an array and is populated by an array of USAGE report table key
  The Mongo Class Create USAGE Activity data as a series of documents.
  4. Workload Activity  
  ![](/Documentation/Images/workloadschema.png)  
  For USAGE report, the main document definition is named workloadActivitySchema. The document contains the following fields:
  - title:
    Title is a string that represent the report title
  - Date
    This is a string that represent the Workload report date.
  - Time
    This is a string that represent the Workload report time.
