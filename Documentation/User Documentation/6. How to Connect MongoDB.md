  - Connect to the MongoDB instance
  For example, open a new terminal and connect a mongo shell to the instance:  
  Specify additional command line options as appropriate to connect the mongo shell to your deployment, such as –host
  - Create the user administrator
  From the mongo shell, add a user with the userAdminAnyDatabase role in the admin database. Include additional roles as needed for this user. For example, the following creates the user myUserAdmin in the admin database with the userAdminAnyDatabase role and the readWriteAnyDatabase role.
