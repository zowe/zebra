## How to Connect MongoDB to Zebra
  The first step in connecting MongoDB to zebra is setting the value of ***useMongo*** config parameter to ***“true”*** in ***Zconfig.json***.  
  1. ***Without Authentication***  
  If a user choose to connect Zebra to MongoDB without Authentication, he/she will need to set ***useDbAuth*** parameter to ***"false"*** and provide the correct values for other config parameters.
  2.  ***With Authentication***  
  If a user choose to connect to MongoDB using username and password. The user will need to follow these procedures:
  - ***Enable MongoDB Access Control***  
  To Enable MongoDB Access Control, the user will first need to create a Username and password with a read Write Permission/Role. To do this, the user will need to:  
      - ***Connect to the MongoDB instance***  
      For example, open a new terminal and connect a mongo shell to the instance:  
      Specify additional command line options as appropriate to connect the mongo shell to your deployment, such as ***–host***  
      - ***Create the user administrator***  
      From the mongo shell, add a user with the ***userAdminAnyDatabase*** role in the admin database. Include additional roles as needed for this user. For example, the following creates the user ***myUserAdmin*** in the admin database with the ***userAdminAnyDatabase*** role and the ***readWriteAnyDatabase*** role.
