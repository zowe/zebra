## How to Connect Grafana to Prometheus
  When Prometheus has been connected to Zebra, the values scraped by Prometheus can be used to create Realtime dashboards using Grafana.  \
  - Data Source
  Prometheus will be our data source and the data it scrapes will be used to plot our real time chart. Use the following steps to add Prometheus as a data source to Grafana.

  i. After logging into Grafana, click on the configuration button and select **Data source** (as shown by the yellow arrow in the image above).
  ii. Click on **Add data source** button (as shown by the yellow arrow in the image below)

  Finally, Click on **Save & Test** button as seen in the image above.
  - Build You own Dashboard
  After successfully adding Prometheus as data source to Grafana. You can now create your real time dashboards. Use the following steps to create your dashboard:
  i- From Grafana homepage, click on create **“+”** button (as shown by the yellow arrow in the image below)

  ii- Click on Add new panel button (as shown by the yellow arrow in the image below)

  iii- This shows a panel with 2 sections. The top section as seen in the image below contains the chart display area and options for controlling the chart displayed.
  - The yellow arrow shows a time duration of metrics to plot on the chart.
  - The orange arrow shows the time interval for refreshing the chart
  - The light green arrow points to a button that display more options.

  iv- The image below shows the lower section of the panel. This section allows for selecting the data source and metrics with which to plot the chart.
  - The red arrow point to the name of the data source to use. In this case, the Prometheus data source name is OMP.

  Example of Grafana Panel for CPU Total Utilization
  - Zebra’s Grafana Metrics
  Zebra provides 4 types of metrics based on a unique prefix system:
  1. TOU_ Prefix
  Metrics with **TOU_ Prefix** contains values of Total utilization of an lpar. E.g. **TOU_VIRPT** is a metric containing numeric value of VIRPT lpar Total Utilization.
  2. EFU_ Prefix
  Metrics with **EFU_ Prefix** contains values of Effective utilization of an lpar. E.g. **EFU_VIRPT** is a metric containing numeric value of VIRPT lpar Effective Utilization.
  3. MSU_ Prefix
  Metric with **MSU_ Prefix** contains System’s MSU value E.g. **MSU_VIRPT**.
  4. VC_ Prefix
  Metrics with **VC_ Prefix** contains SYSCPUVC (Percentage of Maximum general purpose processor capacity spent on behalf of a group/class) value. E.g. **VC_TSO** is a metric containing numeric value of TSO Group/Class.
